Created by me as a class project for CSY1080 (Fundamentals of Programming) at the University of Northampton

Game inspired by the classic Snake game

Notes:
  - Work in progress. There are a few more game features I want to add, and I haven't gone through and cleaned up the code or comments.
  - The source code can be found in the "AS1-CSY1080" folder.
  - This project was built within Visual Studio 2022.
